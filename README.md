### Coursework:

### IST 707 Applied Machine Learning

Broad introduction to machine learning, probabilistic reasoning and decision making in uncertain environments. To accomplish our analysis, we use Python packages Sci-Kit Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly written in Jupyter Notebook. 

### IST 718 Big Data Analytics 

 Broad introduction to modern techniques in data science including elastic net regularized regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep learning. It emphasizes a statistical learning point of view, and a careful examination of generalization error, model interpretability, feature engineering, and bias-variance tradeoff. 
Required Apache Spark on Hadoopâ€™s HDFS. The environment we use is Databricks Community Edition, which runs a highly customized version of the Jupyter Notebook.
