### Coursework:

### IST 707 Applied Machine Learning

- Machine learning, probabilistic reasoning and decision making in uncertain environments. 
- To accomplish our analysis, we used Python packages Sci-Kit Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly written in Jupyter Notebook. 

### IST 718 Big Data Analytics 

- Modern techniques in data science including elastic net regularized regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep learning. Emphasis on a statistical learning point of view, and a careful examination of generalization error, model interpretability, feature engineering, and bias-variance tradeoff. 
- Required Apache Spark on Hadoopâ€™s HDFS. The environment we use is Databricks Community Edition, which runs a highly customized version of the Jupyter Notebook.

### ACC 652 Accounting Analytics 

- Accounting analytics including Benford's Law, current and prior period data, anomaly detection, correlation and time series detection, risk assessment and risk scoring, and purchasing card transaction fraud.
- Required Tableau.

### IST 659 Database Administration and Concepts

- The definition, development, and management of databases and their different business applications across industries. Fundamental data and database concepts included conceptual and logical entity-relationship modeling, Structured Query Language (SQL) programming, and web-based database applications.
- The coursework applied schema and data modeling techniques to database management system products using Microsoft Azure.
